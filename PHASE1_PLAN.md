# Phase 1: Backend MVP - Task List

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on completing the backend API infrastructure with authentication (complete), file storage, OCR integration, and receipt processing functionality.

**Estimated Duration**: 12-17 hours of focused development
**Goal**: Working backend API where users can register, login, upload receipts, and view OCR-extracted items

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-02
**Current Status**: ~35% Complete - Authentication fully implemented with tests, infrastructure setup done

## Phase A: Infrastructure & Logging ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority: Medium** - Foundational improvements
**Completed: 2025-11-02**

### A.1 Configure Serilog ✅
- [x] Configure Serilog in `Program.cs`:
  - Add file logging (logs/splittat-.log)
  - Add console logging with colored output
  - Configure minimum log levels
  - Add request logging middleware
- [x] Update existing services to use ILogger injection
- [x] Test logging output (console and file)
- [x] Add development startup logs showing API URLs

### A.2 Global Error Handling Middleware ✅
- [x] Create `Infrastructure/ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs`
- [x] Create consistent error response model:
  - StatusCode (int)
  - Message (string)
  - Details (string?, only in development)
  - Timestamp (DateTime)
- [x] Handle common HTTP status codes:
  - 400 Bad Request (validation errors)
  - 401 Unauthorized
  - 404 Not Found
  - 500 Internal Server Error
- [x] Register middleware in `Program.cs`
- [x] Log all exceptions with Serilog
- [x] Test error responses

### A.3 Swagger/OpenAPI Enhancement ✅
- [x] Configure Swagger UI in `Program.cs` (upgraded from MapOpenApi)
- [x] Add JWT Bearer authentication to Swagger:
  - Add security definition
  - Add "Authorize" button in UI
- [x] Test all auth endpoints in Swagger UI with JWT token

**Key Achievements:**
- Structured logging with Serilog (console + file with daily rotation)
- Global exception handling with consistent error responses
- Full Swagger UI with JWT authentication support
- Development startup logs showing API and Swagger URLs
- All 12 auth tests still passing

---

## Phase B: File Upload & Storage (2-3 hours)
**Priority: High** - Blocks receipt upload functionality

### B.1 File Storage Service
- [ ] Create `Services/FileStorageService.cs`:
  - `Task<string> SaveFileAsync(IFormFile file, Guid userId)` - Returns file path/URL
  - `Task DeleteFileAsync(string filePath)` - Cleanup uploaded file
  - `bool ValidateFile(IFormFile file)` - Validation helper
- [ ] File validation logic:
  - Max file size: 10MB
  - Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, application/pdf
  - Check file exists and is readable
- [ ] Unique filename generation using Guid
- [ ] Create `wwwroot/uploads/` directory structure

### B.2 Image Processing with ImageSharp
- [ ] Add image optimization in FileStorageService:
  - Resize images if width > 2000px (maintain aspect ratio)
  - Compress JPEG quality to 85
  - Convert PNG to JPEG for consistency
  - Skip processing for PDF files
- [ ] Test with various image sizes and formats

### B.3 Static File Serving
- [ ] Configure static files middleware in `Program.cs`:
  - `app.UseStaticFiles()` for wwwroot
  - Map `/uploads` to `wwwroot/uploads/`
- [ ] Test file access via HTTP (e.g., http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename.jpg)

### B.4 Register Service
- [ ] Add FileStorageService to DI container in `Program.cs`
- [ ] Create interface `IFileStorageService` for testability (optional for MVP)

---

## Phase C: OCR Integration (3-4 hours)
**Priority: High** - Core feature for receipt processing

### C.1 Choose OCR Provider
**Decision: Google Vision API (recommended for MVP)**
- Reasons: Better accuracy, simpler setup, good documentation
- Alternative: AWS Textract (more complex, better for structured documents)

### C.2 OCR Service Setup
- [ ] Install NuGet package: `Google.Cloud.Vision.V1`
- [ ] Create Google Cloud account (if needed)
- [ ] Enable Vision API and get API credentials (JSON key file)
- [ ] Store credentials using .NET User Secrets:
  - `dotnet user-secrets init`
  - `dotnet user-secrets set "Ocr:CredentialsPath" "/path/to/credentials.json"`
- [ ] Add OCR configuration to `appsettings.json`:
  ```json
  "Ocr": {
    "Provider": "GoogleVision",
    "CredentialsPath": ""
  }
  ```

### C.3 OCR Models
- [ ] Create `Models/OcrResult.cs`:
  - `string RawText` - Full OCR text
  - `string? MerchantName` - Extracted merchant
  - `DateTime? Date` - Extracted date
  - `decimal? Total` - Extracted total amount
  - `List<string> Items` - Raw line items
  - `float Confidence` - OCR confidence score (0-1)

### C.4 OCR Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `Services/OcrService.cs`:
  - `Task<OcrResult> ExtractTextAsync(string imagePath)`
  - Google Vision API integration
  - Error handling for API failures
  - Retry logic for transient errors (max 3 retries)
  - Log API calls and results
- [ ] Register OcrService in DI (`Program.cs`)

### C.5 Receipt Text Parser
- [ ] Create receipt parsing logic in OcrService:
  - **Merchant name**: Extract from top 3 lines (largest font/first non-empty)
  - **Date**: Regex patterns for common formats:
    - MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY
    - Month DD, YYYY
    - YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Line items**: Pattern matching for "item name....$X.XX"
  - **Total**: Keywords - "total", "amount due", "balance"
  - **Tax**: Keywords - "tax", "hst", "gst", "vat"
  - **Tip**: Keywords - "tip", "gratuity"
- [ ] Handle multiple receipt formats (grocery, restaurant, retail)
- [ ] Test with sample receipts

---

## Phase E: Testing & Polish (2-3 hours)
**Priority: Medium** - Quality assurance

### E.1 Receipt Endpoint Tests
- [ ] Create `Splittat.API.Tests/ReceiptEndpointsTests.cs`:
  - Upload receipt (authorized user) - should return 201
  - Upload receipt (unauthorized) - should return 401
  - Upload receipt with invalid file type - should return 400

## Notes & Decisions

### OCR Provider Choice
**Decision: Google Vision API**
- Pros: Better accuracy, simpler setup, excellent documentation
- Cons: Requires Google Cloud account (free tier available)
- Alternative considered: AWS Textract (more complex, better for forms/tables)

### Storage Strategy
**Decision: Local file storage (wwwroot/uploads/)**
- Sufficient for MVP
- Easy to migrate to cloud storage later (Azure Blob/S3)
- Add cloud storage in Phase 3 or 4

### Image Format
**Decision: Convert all images to JPEG**
- Consistent format for OCR processing
- Smaller file sizes
- Good quality at 85% compression

### Pagination
**Decision: Optional query parameters**
- Default: page=1, pageSize=20
- Allows future scalability without breaking changes

## Next Steps After Phase 1 Backend

Once Phase 1 backend is complete, coordinate with frontend development to:
1. Test API integration with frontend
2. Verify CORS and authentication flow
3. Test file upload from browser
4. Validate error handling and user experience

Then move to Phase 2 which focuses on:
- Implementing cost splitting functionality
- Creating split calculator service
- Building group management endpoints
- Multi-person split calculations
